## Next.js + Electron Template

This template contains a copy of nextron. I adjusted it as there were a couple of things that made it unstable. This project is a template and not a replacement for Nextron. You should definitely check nextron out as it's a good way to avoid having the type of configurations in the file tree like this project has it.

Additionally this project brings Typescript and React Stitches together with Electron, which can definitely save you a lot of time.
